    "                ABSTRACT \\n We have measured the infrared (2.08-14 um) directional hemispherical reflectance spectra of lunar soils representing the major lithologic units so far sampled on the lunar surface, and soils of different exposure ages within those units.  Such reflectance (R) spectra can be used to calculate absolute emissivity (E) using Kirchhoffs Law (E=1-R).  The effects of exposure age vary with wavelength region.  In the 2-5 um and 8-14 um regions, lunar soils darken with exposure age, consistent with spectral behavior in the VNIR, and the dominant optical effect of increasing amounts of finely divided metallic iron in more mature soils.  However, in the 5-8 um region soils tend to show higher reflectances with greater exposure age, which suggests some unanticipated change in the optical properties of fine metallic iron at those wavelengths.  The most useful spectral feature for compositional remote sensing is the Christiansen reflectance minimum (emissivity maximum), the spectral contrast of which is enhanced by the lunar environment, and the wavelength position of which is little affected by exposure age.  By contrast, the weak and relatively few overtone/combination tone absorption bands in the volume scattering region between 3 and 8 um appear to be of limited usefulness.  The reststrahlen bands are also very weak in absolute emissivity spectra, and are evidently not enhanced by the lunar environment in the same fashion as the Christiansen feature.  Thus, they can only be used for remote sensing with measurements of extraordinarily high signal-to-noise (1000/1).  However, these features, as well as the transparency feature, do contain important mineralogical information, such as the relative abundances of plagioclase and pyroxene, and can be used for laboratory studies of lunar soils.  More certain and more quantitative mineralogical analyses of lunar soils appear feasible after additional spectral analysis of soil separates, and additional petrologic analysis of soil samples for which spectral data are available. \\n \\\n",
    "                INTRODUCTION \\n \\\n",
    "                Since the earliest days of spectroscopic remote sensing of the lunar surface, electronic transition bands exhibited by lunar soils in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) regions of the spectrum have been used to determine mineralogical composition (e.g.,McCord and Johnson, 1970; McCord et al., 1972; Adams, 1974).  There was also early recognition of the effects of space weathering on lunar soils and on their spectral reflectance (e.g., McKay et al., 1974; Hapke et al., 1975; Morris, 1976; Charette et al., 1976; and Basu, 1977.), resulting in a basic model which does, however, continue to undergo refinement (e.g., Pieters et al., 1993; Fischer and Pieters, 1994; and Clark and Johnson, 1996).  Briefly, lunar soils are derived principally by comminution of the underlying rocks by hypervelocity impact.  Over time, a rain of micrometeorite impacts continues the comminution process but, along with solar wind sputtering, also produces progressively more melt and vapor phase from such a particulate layer.  \\\n",
    "                Reduction of Fe2+ results in submicroscopic iron metal particles in the glass and deposited from vapor on the surfaces of grains.  Although other processes affect an aging soil, it is the iron particles in and on grains, primarily in glass-welded agglutinates, that principally account for the darkening and reddening of lunar soil reflectance with age of exposure on the lunar surface, as well as for the decrease in spectral contrast of the electronic transition bands.  Consequently, a good method for relating the exposure age of lunar soil to its changing optical properties is to use ferromagnetic resonance to measure the intensity of the characteristic resonance from single-domain iron within the soil normalized to the FeO content, yielding the widely used exposure index, Is/FeO (Morris, 1976).  This approach was used by Fischer (1995) to select suites of lunar soils of similar composition but different exposure ages to study the effect of lunar space weathering on reflectance spectra, a model which we also follow in this paper.\\\n",
    "                In contrast with the range and sophistication of research done in the VNIR, much less is known about the spectral behavior of lunar soils in the thermal infrared.  Early work by Lyon (1965) showed that the fundamental Si-O stretching vibration bands (the reststrahlen bands) of silicates are greatly diminished in intensity, or spectral contrast, as particle size is reduced, making them difficult to detect in emission from a particulate surface such as the lunar regolith.  \\\n",
    "                Conel (1969) demonstrated that there exists an ancillary spectral feature, only indirectly related to the reststrahlen bands, that is relatively unaffected by particle size and can be used to determine composition.  More than one explanation has been offered for this so-called Christiansen feature (Hapke, 1996).  The traditional explanation for this feature, located near but not at the Christiansen frequency, is that it occurs in a wavelength region where the real part of the refractive index undergoes rapid change and thus may approach the refractive index of the medium (air or vacuum) surrounding the mineral grains, resulting in minimal scattering.  Because this takes place at a slightly shorter wavelength than the fundamental molecular vibration band, absorption is still relatively low.  With little backscattering and little absorption, infrared radiation can pass through a sample relatively easily, resulting in a minimum in reflectance or a maximum in emittance.  This explanation agrees with experimental results, such as those obtained in vacuum described below, and is preferred by us.  Whatever its origin, the wavelength of this Christiansen feature was related to mineral composition by Conel (1969) and to igneous rock type by Logan et al. (1973), and Salisbury and Walter (1989).\\\n",
    "                Logan and Hunt (1970) found that a vacuum environment can introduce thermal gradients in a particulate sample that will significantly increase spectral contrast of the Christiansen emission peak.  In a vacuum, the lack of interstitial gas molecules results in very slow heat transfer between grains primarily by conduction across the small asperity points of contact, compared to the more rapid convective heat transport when gas is present.  For silicates, the optical depth in the visible region of the spectrum is greater than it is in the thermal infrared region.  Consequently, visible radiation penetrates to a greater depth in the sample than the depth from which particles are radiating heat into space.  Logan and Hunt (1970) showed that under such conditions a cold skin of particles develops over a warmer interior.  Given such a thermal gradient, radiation passing relatively easily through the sample in the region of the Christiansen emission peak arises primarily from the relatively warm interior.  In the reststrahlen bands, however, where the absorption coefficient is high, radiation from the warm interior is absorbed before it reaches the surface and, consequently, the relatively cool surface layer dominates sample emittance at these wavelengths.  In effect, different temperatures are being observed at different wavelengths.  The net result, if the brightness temperature at the Christiansen peak is assumed to be the kinetic temperature (which is the usual assumption, because this is the wavelength of maximum emissivity), is a calculated emissivity curve that displays a greatly enhanced Christiansen peak compared to the reststrahlen band region, because of the disparity in radiance associated with the difference in effective temperatures.  It is not clear that this increase in overall contrast of the spectral curve is accompanied by increased contrast of the individual spectral features within the reststrahlen region.  The spectra obtained in a simulated environment by Logan and Hunt (1970) did not appear to have enhanced reststrahlen band fine structure, and they concluded that the prominent Christiansen emission peak was the spectral feature most likely to provide compositional information.  More recent vacuum chamber experiments by Henderson et al. (1996) confirm the enhancement of the Christiansen peak, and appear to show that reststrahlen features are actually slightly reduced in spectral contrast in the vacuum environment.\\\n",
    "                A second order effect of the enhanced spectral contrast of the Christiansen emission peak is a systematic shift of the peak to shorter wavelength due to the increased steepness of the falloff in emissivity toward the reststrahlen band on its long wavelength side (Salisbury and Walter, 1989; Henderson et al., 1996).  Salisbury and Walter (1989) documented this shift of the Christiansen feature by comparing spectral emission measurements of different powdered igneous rock types in vacuum (Logan et al., 1973) with their own directional hemispherical reflectance measurements of the same rock powders in air.  They showed that the shift was systematic and determined a correction factor.  They also showed that the wavelength of the Christiansen feature could be correlated with a chemical index that is a good indicator of igneous rock type. This SCFM index is the ratio of the oxide abundance of silica to the combined oxide abundances of silica, calcium, iron and magnesium.\\\n",
    "                Another spectral feature that may be useful for compositional remote sensing of particulate surfaces occurs in a wavelength region of relative transparency between regions of high absorption coefficient associated with the Si-O stretching and O-Si-O bending vibration bands.  These fundamental vibration bands are dominated by surface scattering, which is why the reststrahlen bands are reflectance peaks.  In between these bands, the absorption coefficient is sufficiently low that the silicate grains become optically thin and volume scattering comes to dominate the scattering process as particle size is reduced. This enhanced volume scattering also results in a broad reflectance peak, the wavelength of which has been shown to be related to mineral composition and terrestrial igneous rock type (Salisbury and Walter, 1989).\\\n",
    "                All of these measurements of terrestrial surrogates have been accompanied by relatively few measurements of the Moon and of returned lunar soils.  Remote sensing measurements of the Moon have been badly hampered by atmospheric absorption and other problems.  The controversial results have been reviewed by Nash et al. (1993) and Salisbury et al. (1995), and will not be considered here. Laboratory spectral emission measurements of returned lunar soils in a vacuum environment have shown qualitatively, however, the prominent Christiansen peak and barely discernible reststrahlen features expected from surrogate measurements (Logan et al., 1972; Salisbury et al., 1973).  Some of these laboratory spectra are reproduced in Figure 1a.\\\n",
    "                Figure 1a.  Emission spectra of Apollo 16 soil samples measured in a simulated lunar environment.  Emissivity has been calculated assuming an emissivity of 1.0 at the Christiansen peak, and spectra are displaced \tvertically by 0.1 increments (from Salisbury et al., 1973). \\n \\\n",
    "                To date, only one lunar soil has been measured in both emission in a simulated lunar environment and in directional hemispherical reflectance from which absolute emissivity can be calculated (Figure 1b).  Unfortunately, the emission spectrum does not span the entire wavelength region available for remote sensing through the atmospheric window, and has relatively low (1.5%) spectral resolution.  Still, it does show quantitatively the enhancement of the Christiansen peak in a vacuum environment and, despite the low resolution of emission spectrum, what appears to be reduced spectral contrast of the reststrahlen features.  However, this soil sample had the lowest spectral contrast of all of the soil samples measured by Logan et al. (1972) and Salisbury et al. (1973) in a vacuum environment, making the difference so small between the two measurements that no firm conclusion can be reached.\\n \\\n",
    "                Figure 1b.  Comparison of spectra of lunar soil 10084 measured in emission in a simulated lunar environment and in directional hemispherical reflectance in air (emission measurement from Logan et al., 1972).  Note that the shift of wavelength associated with the thermal gradient imposed by the simulated lunar environment is very small for such mafic rocks, as found by Salisbury and Walter (1989).  The expanded scale shows subtle reststrahlen features.\\n \\\n",
    "                Other laboratory measurements of lunar soil spectra in the thermal infrared are few in number, and are difficult to relate to the measurements of lunar soils and soil surrogates outlined above for a variety of reasons.  Aronson and Smith (1978) and Aronson et al. (1979) made some spectral measurements in a vacuum environment, but presented their data in a brightness temperature format instead of calculated emissivity.  Still, they do show brightness temperature curves for samples 67711 and 10084, and conclude that the former has the most spectral contrast of any soil sample they measured, and the latter has the least, which is consistent with the measurements shown in Figure 1.  It is also consistent with the findings in this paper about the effects of soil exposure age.\\n \\\n",
    "                Nash (1991) made biconical reflectance measurements, which cannot be quantitatively converted to emissivity (Nicodemus, 1965).  In addition, the samples were slightly packed, which slightly enhances the reststrahlen features. Again, however, there is good qualitative agreement with conclusions drawn above.  That is, spectra of rock chips display greater spectral contrast than the spectra of disaggregated breccias, and much greater contrast than the spectra of soils.  \\n \\\n",
    "                It is the purpose of this paper to: 1) provide the first directional hemispherical reflectance spectra (interpretable in terms of absolute emissivity) of soil samples representative of all of the major lunar lithologic units sampled so far; 2) document the effect of exposure age on the thermal infrared spectral properties of these soils; 3) determine the extent to which the wavelength of the Christiansen peak can be correlated with the SCFM chemical index of lunar soils, and whether or not soil exposure age affects this correlation; 4) identify reststrahlen features in lunar soil spectra that are due to different minerals; and 5) determine the extent to which mineral abundances estimated from reststrahlen features correlate with the normative mineral abundances calculated from soil chemistry. We recognize the need for caution in applying our findings directly to remote sensing of lunar composition because of the effect of the lunar environment on the shape of the spectral curve, especially the magnitude and wavelength of the Christiansen peak.  However, we believe that it is best to start with absolute emissivity and then account for lunar environmental effects, as has been done for the wavelength position of the Christiansen peak by Salisbury and Walter (1989), rather than to use qualitative data obtained with an always questionable environmental simulation.  Further, the results reported here can be directly applied to laboratory investigations of lunar soils.\\n \\\n",
    "                SAMPLE SELECTION \\n \\\n",
    "                In the absence of any accurate means to artificially mimic the evolution of lunar soils, Fischer (1995) selected suites of returned soils of similar compositions but different exposure ages, which  were then assumed to approximate the evolution of a soil of a given composition.  To this end, he identified soils with a wide range of exposure age as quantified by Is/FeO (Morris, 1976), which were within 1 wt.% FeO, Al2O3, and TiO2 of selected immature soils.  Soils selected in this manner which displayed VNIR absorption band centers different from their counterparts (indicative of mineralogical differences) were discarded.  This process resulted in selection of four compositionally distinct suites of three to four soils each, with each soil sample in a suite presumably representing a distinct evolutionary stage of soil development.  We have adopted this model and used the fine fraction (< 1 mm) of each of these soils as representative of the surface layer.  In addition, we have selected an additional mare soil (10084) to extend the soil types to include a high titanium mare soil, and have added several other soil samples similar to those originally selected by Fischer (1995) to guard against possible bias introduced by too few samples.  The Fischer sample suites are described below and all sample selections are documented in Table 1.\\n \\\n",
    "                Soil Suites \\n \\\n",
    "                The Apollo 16a Reference Suite:  This suite, consisted of four soils: 61221, 67701, 60051 and 64801, in order of increasing exposure age as determined by the Is/FeO index (see Table 1).  Whereas most Apollo 16 soils can be interpreted as mixtures of at least two or three lithologic components (Houck, 1982; Basu and McKay, 1984), the group of soils represented by this reference suite is characterized by relatively higher aluminum and lower iron and titanium concentrations than other Apollo 16 soils, and is likely derived dominantly, but not purely, from the friable light matrix breccia unit sample most notably by the North Ray crater impact.\\n \\\n",
    "                The Apollo 16b Reference Suite:  This suite consists of soils 67941, 61241, and 68501, in order of increasing exposure age as determined by the Is/FeO index (see Table 1).  This suite, slightly less aluminous than the Apollo 16a suite, was selected by Fischer (1995) to determine whether very subtle compositional differences relative to the Apollo 16a suite might have noticeable effects upon optical alteration.  As Fischer (1995) found in the VNIR, we find that the subtle compositional differences are reflected in significant differences in the thermal infrared spectra as described below in the Results section. \\n \\\n",
    "                The Apollo 14 Reference Suite:  This suite consists of soils 14141, 14149, and 14148, in order of increasing exposure age as determined by the Is/FeO index (see Table 1).  This suite represents materials transitional between highlands and mare in terms of major element chemistry.\\n \\\n",
    "                The Apollo 12 Reference Suite:  The Apollo 12 suite consists of soils 12030, 12024, and 12023, in order of increasing exposure age as determined by the Is/FeO index (see Table 1).  This suite is the one mare reference suite for analysis of exposure age effects.  It represents a low-titanium mare lithology.\\n \\\n",
    "                INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE \\n \\\n",
    "                Laboratory Directional Hemispherical Reflectance Measurements\\n \\\n",
    "                Directional hemispherical reflectance measurements were made at 4-wavenumber resolution using a Nicolet FTIR spectrometer with a gold-coated integrating sphere and a liquid nitrogen-cooled, mercury-cadmium-telluride detector.  Samples were measured at a wall-mounted port at the bottom of the sphere, and illuminated at 10 off of the vertical through a port in the top of the sphere.  Spectra were calibrated to absolute reflectance using a gold mirror and standards traceable to NIST (Salisbury and Walter, 1989).\\\n",
    "                As shown by Nicodemus (1965), such 10 directional hemispherical reflectance measurements (R) can be used to predict directional spectral emissivity (E) using Kirchhoffs Law (E=1-R).\\\n",
    "                Sample Preparation\\n \\\n",
    "                Each lunar soil sample (<1 mm fraction) was poured onto a fresh, waxed weighing paper from its container as received from the Lunar Sample Curator, and the paper was gently shaken sideways to flatten the sample prior to spectral measurement while still on the weighing paper.\\\n",
    "                A better simulation of the underdense nature of the upper surface of the lunar regolith might have been obtained by sifting the samples, but we did not want to risk the sample contamination that would inevitably result.  One sample was measured both sifted through a 75 um screen and poured as described above to illustrate the spectral differences that might result from the smaller grain size and higher porosity at the surface of the sifted sample.  As shown in Figure 2, the sifted sample has a considerably higher reflectance in the 2-8 um region, and a slightly lower reflectance in the 8-14 um region.  This spectral behavior is the result of the changing opacity of silicate minerals with wavelength.  That is, in the wavelength region where the sample is relatively transparent there is an increase of reflectance with decreased particle size, because more photons survive passage through the smaller gains to be backscattered to the observer.  In  regions of high opacity, on the other hand, there is a net loss of photons due to the absorption that occurs with the increased volume scattering associated with smaller grain size and higher porosity (Salisbury and Wald, 1992).  The change in spectral reflectance between sifted and poured samples is relatively small in the reststrahlen bands, where the sample is most opaque, because the interaction of radiation with the sample occurs at or near the sample surface. Thus, even when more large grains are present at the surface, as in the case of the poured sample, the smaller particles with which they are invariably coated tend to dominate this near-surface interaction (Salisbury and Wald, 1992).  \\n \\\n",

    "                In her thorough review of the use of infrared spectroscopy in mineralogy, Estep-Barnes (1977) listed infrared spectral libraries for minerals, rocks, and inorganic compounds published prior to 1975.  Only Hunt and Salisbury (1975, 1976), Lyon and Green (1975), Vincent et al. (1975), and Ferraro (1982) have been published subsequently.  Most of these libraries consist of transmittance measurements, which have limited application to remote sensing problems because they do not include the effects of scattering (Salisbury et al., 1987a). Only the works of Lyon (1963, 1964), Lyon and Green (1975), Hunt and Salisbury (1974, 1975, 1976), and Vincent et al. (1975) contain reflectance and/or emittance data that can be used to predict the  spectral behavior of minerals and rocks in a remote sensing situation. However, these data lack the potentially significant 3-5 micrometers region of the spectrum, do not document the effects of different particle sizes on the spectra of most samples, typically lack complete chemical and mineralogical sample characterization, and are not available in digital form.  The present work seeks to remedy all of these shortcomings for 130 minerals.  It is an expansion on an Open-File Report of the U. S. Geological Survey (Salisbury et al., 1987a) which, not being generally available to the public, was of limited usefulness to the remote sensing community.  The present work also adds digital data for all of the spectra in ASCII format on an accompanying CD-ROM disk. \\\n",
    "                Experimental Technique: \\n \\\n",
    "                Acquisition and Preparation of Samples  Most samples were acquired, often as single crystals, from the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History.  Other samples were obtained from the Hunt and Salisbury collection in Denver or from individuals. Most samples were crushed in a steel percussion mortar, after which steel particles were removed with a hand magnet.  Crushed samples were hand-picked when impurities were present, ultrasonically cleaned, and then subjected, when necessary, to an acid wash to insure purity.  Samples were ground in a sintered sapphire mortar under either acetone or (more commonly) alcohol, which facilitated grinding, avoided disordering of the sheet silicates, and prevented the finest particles from drifting away as aerosols.Particulate samples were dry-sieved to two different particle-size ranges (75-250 micrometers and 0-75 micrometers), and the coarser particle-size range was subsequently washed in acetone or alcohol to remove clinging fines.  Clay samples were disaggregated ultrasonically, and the <2 micrometers size fraction was concentrated with a centrifuge.\\\n",
    "                Characterization of Samples:  \\n \\\n",
    "                Mineral specimens were initially examined as hand samples and, after grinding to a powder, under a petrographic microscope.  This examination was typically combined with X-ray diffraction and microprobe analysis to identify those samples that were pure mineral phases and to establish their chemical and mineral compositions.  When other approaches to characterization were employed, this is noted in the mineral description sheets.  Unless otherwise noted on the description sheets, petrography was performed by Dana DAria, microprobe analyses by Louis Walter, and X-ray diffraction analysis by Norma Vergo.The 0-75 micrometers fraction (except where noted) of all samples was characterized by X-ray diffraction using a Siemens D-500 X-ray diffractometer with CuKa radiation.  Samples were mounted using a side pack sample holder to achieve random orientation.  There were several samples that appeared to be monomineralic when studied by optical methods, but that had \"extra\" peaks in the X-ray patterns compared to the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) file cards.  These patterns were modeled by calculating allowed d-spacings from input unit cell dimensions using the Appleman and Evans (1973) cell refinement program.  The differences between the JCPDS and modeled patterns typically could be attributed to differences in ionic substitutions.Additional tests were done to characterize the clay minerals.  The <2 micrometers fraction was oriented on a glass slide using a Millipore  filter setup (Drever, 1973).  These slides were then analyzed in the air-dried and glycol-solvated states.  K-saturation was done on the vermiculite sample.  The mixed-layer clay minerals were modeled using methods outlined in Reynolds (1980) and using the New Mod computer program written by R. C. Reynolds (Dartmouth College). Microprobe analyses were performed on 75-250 micrometer sample fractions.  Through kind permission, the Applied Research Laboratory instrument at the Smithsonian Institution Division of Mineral Sciences was used.  Six fixed-wavelength dispersive detectors were used to analyze for Si, Al, Fe, Mg, Ca, and K.  Three movable, wavelength-dispersive detectors were used to analyze for Na, Ti, and Mn.  Quartz was used as a background standard for Al; alumina was used as a background standard for all other elements.Standards employed were selected from those available at the Smithsonian:  rhodonite for Mn and Kakanui hornblende for all other elements.  The Bence-Albee correction procedure was used to convert intensity ratios to element/oxide abundances.  As usual for microprobe analyses, ferric and ferrous iron were not distinguished and Fe is reported as FeO. In analyzing a mineral, points were accumulated for 10-second integration times.  Normally, four or five randomly selected points were analyzed on one or two grains.  Then, individual points were run on five or six additional grains.  If these analyses were equivalent within statistical counting error, the material was assumed to be homogeneous.  In some cases, small deviations from homogeneity were found and these are noted in the text.  \\\n",
    "                Estimated errors (as determined by replicate analyses) are: \\n \\\n",
    "                Oxide\tCoefficient of Variation (Rel. %) \\n SiO2\t1.7 \\n Al2O3  2 \\n FeO\t2 \\n MgO\t2 \\n CaO\t2 \\n K2O\t3 \\n Na2O\t5 \\n TiO2\t2 \\n MnO\t1 \\n \\\n",
    "                These estimates apply to cases in which the oxide abundance is greater than 3%.  The limit of reliable detection is generally about 0.5%.\\\n",
    "                We found that all three different modes of sample characterization, microscopic, X-ray, and microprobe or other chemical analysis, were required to assure sample purity.  Based on this sample characterization process, generally two out of every three mineral samples were found to be insufficiently pure to be included in this compilation.  The results of the analyses are documented on each sample description sheet.  Mineral names and ideal formulae used on these sheets were taken from Fleischer (1983).\\\n",
    "                Acquisition of Spectra  \\n \\\n",
    "                Spectra were acquired at 4 cm-1 resolution using either a Nicolet 5 DXB or a Nicolet System 510 interferometer spectrometer; both spectrometers have identical optical benches  Transmittance and biconical reflectance spectral data were recorded from 2.08 to 25 micrometers with a triglycine sulfate (TGS) detector, and directional hemispherical reflectance data were recorded from 2.08 to 14 micrometers with a liquid helium-cooled, mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT) detector.\\\n",
    "                Transmittance was measured by passing the focused beam ( 6 mm diameter) of the interferometer through a KBr disk (commonly referred to as a pellet) containing sample material made in the manner of Stimson and ODonnell (1952).  Briefly, these pellets consist of 300 mg of KBr mixed with about 0.7 mg of sample ground under alcohol to a size range less than 2 micrometers.  The pellets were pressed in a dye under vacuum for five minutes at 10,000 kg/cm2 pressure to produce transparent disks 13 mm in diameter and 1 mm thick.  A reference pellet composed of pure KBr was used to record a background against which was ratioed the sample pellet transmittance.\\\n",
    "                Biconical reflectance spectra were recorded using a Spectra Tech Collector diffuse reflectance attachment, which uses two 90-off-axis ellipsoids that act as 6x beam condensers; the focused beam diameter is thus reduced to 1 mm, and illumination and reflection occur at the specular angle over a solid angle that closely approaches p steradians.  Thus, our bidirectional reflectance measurements actually record biconical reflectance over a large solid angle.\\\n",
    "                An aluminum mirror was used as the background reference against which sample biconical reflectance was ratioed.  A mirror was used as the reference instead of Halon, because the latter exhibits strong absorption bands in most of the spectral range measured here.  Not only does the mirror provide a spectrally flat reference, but its high reflectance is required when measuring the reflectance of solid samples at the wavelengths of the fundamental molecular vibration bands.  As described below, minerals have a mirror-like opacity at such wavelengths, and smooth solid samples may have reflectances close to that of a mirror.  Use of biconical reflectance with a mirror reference makes the measured reflectance of a diffusely reflecting particulate sample roughly a factor of five lower than it would be for the integrating sphere measurements commonly made in the visible and near-infrared.\\\n",
    "                The Nicolet 5DXB and System 510 can switch the infrared beam from the sample compartment to an external port, through which it exits in collimated form.  An integrating sphere, coated inside with a diffusely reflecting gold surface, was attached to the instrument at this port.  The sphere is 12.7 cm in diameter and has a 2.5 cm diameter entrance port in the top of the sphere at 10 off the vertical, through which the beam passes to fall on a 2.5 cm diameter sample/reference port in the bottom of the sphere.  Beam size on the sample in that bottom port is 1.54 cm.  A 2.5 cm detector port is placed at an angle of 90 to the principal plane in the side of the sphere, and the liquid-nitrogen-cooled MCT detector chip is baffled to eliminate direct viewing of either the sample or the specular hot spot on the sphere wall.  A port at the specular angle was filled during the measurements reported below with a gold-coated plug having a surface curved to match the interior curvature of the sphere.\\\n",
    "                The integrating sphere uses a Labsphere diffuse gold surface as a reference. Sphere performance was carefully calibrated to provide absolute reflectance by comparing measured reflectances of Halon, a front-surface aluminum mirror, water, and a black body cone with values obtained from the National Bureau of Standards or found in the literature (Salisbury and Milton, 1987).\\\n",
    "                The usual sample holder for biconical reflectance measurements was 13 mm in diameter and 2 mm deep, although a microreflectance holder 3 mm x 2 mm could also be used for very small samples.  The usual sample holder for hemispherical reflectance measurements was 2.5 cm in diameter and 3 mm deep.  That samples were optically thick at a depth of 2 mm was verified by comparison of spectra measured in bare aluminum cups with spectra measured in cups painted black.  Most particulate samples were sifted into the sample holders to attempt to achieve random orientation of grains.  For some samples, including all of the clay minerals, solid samples were not available.  In these cases, the fine powder samples were packed into a pseudo-solid sample so that the reflectance peaks of the fundamental molecular vibration (reststrahlen) bands could be seen.  This was accomplished with <2 micrometers clays by placing them in a folded weighing paper and gently rolling a sample bottle over the outside surface.  This produced cohesive flakes that could be readily transferred to the reflectance attachment and measured.  Some samples such as the olivines, were not sufficiently fine-grained to produce flakes.  To make packed sample measurements of these samples, they were simply pressed into a sample cup with the flat side of a spatula.  Solid samples were fixed in a bed of moldable erasure to hold the surface being measured in a horizontal position. All samples could be raised or lowered by a micrometer screw mechanism so that the measurement surface was at the beam focus.\\\n",
    "                The Nicolet scans an interferogram each second.  Interferograms are then averaged to provide the desired signal-to-noise after deconvolution to a spectrum.  This normally required 100 scans for transmittance measurements and 500 to 1000 scans for reflectance.\\\n",
    "                Major Spectral Features of Minerals \\n \\\n",
    "                The spectral features of minerals in the wavelength range considered here are the result of vibrational processes.  Their number, intensity and shape are dependent on atomic masses, interatomic force fields and, particularly, molecular geometry.  One goal of the spectroscopist is to quantitatively describe the vibrational process so that the origin of each absorption band can be understood.  Sophisticated calculations have been made that are consistent with observation, at least for the simpler minerals (e.g., Elcombe, 1967), although not necessarily correct or final.  Even if a vibrational mode were understood precisely, it is virtually impossible to describe such a motion simply and concisely for such complex structures as silicates.  Consequently, one must rely on some very general description, such as Si-O symmetric stretch, to describe all those vibrations which predominantly involve the symmetric expansion and contraction of the silicon-oxygen bonds.  Using such simplified visualizations, we can successfully generalize about the spectral behavior of minerals.  For example, lighter atoms vibrate at higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths) than heavier atoms when substituted into the same structure (see olivines, p. 168-192).  Higher bond strengths also result in higher frequencies of vibration, and this change in bonding in silicates is related to the degree of polymerization of the Si-O4 ion (Walter and Salisbury, 1989).  This results in a systematic change in wavelengths of the fundamental vibration bands of silicates as the framework structure ultimately gives way to isolated tetrahedra.  Finally, bond-stretching vibrations in covalent structures lie at higher frequencies than bending modes, and such internal molecular vibrations typically lie at higher frequencies than lattice modes (Farmer, 1974).\\\n",
    "                The most prominent features in the infrared spectra of minerals can be understood in the context of the generalizations outlined above and are described below for different types of minerals.  In particular, we point out those bands seen in reflectance or emittance that are not apparent in the transmittance spectra typically studied by others.  This discussion of the origins of spectral features is not repeated in the text for each mineral, because it would prove highly repetitious for the relatively well understood bands, such as the fundamental internal molecular vibration bands of the minerals and associated water and hydroxyl.  Those bands can easily be identified in the spectra of each mineral on the basis of the discussion below.  The attribution of more complex features due to overtones and combination tones of the internal vibrations and lattice modes is a more speculative matter, even for the simplest of minerals.  Such speculation would also be repetitious and is not the function of this work.  Farmer (1974) discusses the spectral features of minerals at length, and Farmer and Palmieri (1975) provide an exhaustive list of references categorized by mineral.  Estep-Barnes (1977) presented a good review of the major spectral features of minerals, accompanied by an extensive bibliography.  The interested reader is referred to these works for the best information on the subject of detailed band assignments.\\\n",
    "                Silicates:  \\n \\\n",
    "                The most intense spectral features of silicates, occurring between 8 and 12 micrometers, are generally described as due simply to fundamental asymmetric Si-O-Si stretching vibrations, but Si-O-Al stretching vibrations may also contribute when aluminum is part of the crystal lattice (for the classic Si-O-Si stretching feature, see the 9.2 micrometers band in quartz).  The appearance of these features typically changes in reflectance because of the role of the refractive index in scattering (see The Role of Surface and Volume Scattering, below).  The weak side band near 8.5 micrometers in the transmittance spectrum of quartz, for example, becomes a well-defined lobe of a prominent reflectance doublet  between 8 and 10 micrometers .  The reflectance spectrum of a quartz glass displays a much weaker short-wavelength lobe, which in some cases of shocked quartz we have seen is reduced to a shoulder.  This simplification of glass spectra of minerals is well known and is attributed generally to broadening of the bands (e.g., Farmer, 1974, p. 484).  However, broadening would not appear to explain the reduced intensity of the 8.5 micrometers band in the spectrum of glass compared to that of crystalline quartz.   An alternative explanation is that the short-wavelength lobe of the strong quartz reflectance doublet is not due entirely to internal molecular vibrations but depends to some extent on long-range order (Simon and McMahon, 1953).   Whatever the details of their origin, these most intense features fall in the 8-14 micrometers atmospheric window, making them the most useful for terrestrial remote sensing of silicates (Kahle and Goetz, 1983; Walter and Salisbury, 1989).\\\n",
    "                The second most intense silicate bands are broadly characterized as O-Si-O deformation or bending modes, which occur in the 18-25 micrometers region.  Again, aluminum and, indeed, other cations may contribute additional band structure in this region (Farmer, 1974, p. 365).  The relative intensities of the two quartz bands in this spectral region appear unchanged in reflectance compared to transmittance, but have been shifted about 1 micrometers to shorter wavelength by the interaction of absorption coefficient and refractive index on the scattered light, which is typical (Salisbury et al., 1987b).  The weaker feature occurring at 18.3 micrometers in reflectance completely disappears in the spectrum of fused silica, indicating such a strong dependence on long-range order that it must be due to a lattice vibration.  \\\n",
    "                Weaker bands in quartz spectra between 12 and 15 micrometers have been attributed to symmetric Si-O-Si stretching vibrations (Farmer, 1974, p. 366).  When some of the silicon atoms are replaced by aluminum, as in the feldspars, additional Si-O-Al stretching vibrations are added over a longer wavelength range.  For example, albite displays eight highly characteristic bands in its spectrum between 12 and 20 micrometers.  Again, such bands are greatly simplified or eliminated in the spectra of glasses (Nash and Salisbury, 1991).\\\n",
    "                Additional weak bands are displayed as troughs between 3 and 7 micrometers.  Such bands in silicate spectra have been largely ignored because they are usually too weak to be seen in transmittance spectra.  However, they can be very useful in the spectral identification of fine particulate minerals and rocks, where they are quite prominent (Salisbury et al., 1987b; Salisbury and Walter, 1989; and Salisbury et al., 1991).  Because they have not been assigned with any certainty, we refer to such bands simply as overtone/combination tone bands of internal and lattice modes. \\\n",
    "                Carbonates:\\n \\\n",
    "                The strongest bands of carbonates are due primarily to fundamental internal molecular vibration bands of the CO3 ion, which are well understood (Farmer, 1974, p. 231).  Carbonates typically display a strong band near 7 micrometers due to asymmetric C-O stretching vibrations and weaker bands near 11.4 and 14.3 micrometers due to bending modes, which can be seen in the spectrum of calcite.  Very weak bands in the transmittance spectrum to shorter wavelength than 7 micrometers are strongly displayed as troughs in the reflectance spectrum of particulate calcite.  Because of their relative visibility in transmittance spectra, these weak bands have been the subject of study and appear to be due to combination tones of internal and lattice modes (Farmer, 1974, p. 236).\\\n",
    "                Sulfates:  \\n \\\n",
    "                The sulfate ion displays a group of intense stretching fundamentals near 8.7 micrometers and two or more bending modes near 16 micrometers, as can be seen in spectra of gypsum and anhydrite.  Again, the weaker features in transmittance spectra of sulfates at shorter wavelength than the strong stretching fundamental are strongly displayed in reflectance spectra of particulate samples.  The complex feature near 4.6 micrometers appears to be a combination tone of the sulphate ion, perhaps accompanied by water combination tones (Hass and Sutherland, 1956).  The features near 2.8 and 6.2 micrometers are due to water, the spectral features of which are discussed separately below.\\\n",
    "                Oxides:  \\n \\\n",
    "                The metal-oxygen stretching vibration bands in oxides occur at longer wavelength than the Si-O features (e.g., chromite).  An interesting aspect of these features is that, because of the intense dipole oscillations induced by the vibrations of highly ionic oxides, their powder spectra are profoundly modified by the shape and size of the particles (Farmer, 1974, p. 183).  Thus, it is sometimes uncertain whether variations in powder spectra given by different specimens of a given compound are due to real differences in purity or phase, or merely to shape and size.  A case in point is provided by spectra of our two goethite samples.\\\n",
    "                Sulfides:  \\n \\\n",
    "                Most metal-sulphur vibration bands lie beyond our wavelength range in the far-infrared.  We have included two examples (pyrite, and pyrrhotite) that do show bands within our wavelength range.\\\n",
    "                Water and Hydroxyl:  \\n \\\n",
    "                The most common vibration bands in minerals are due to water and hydroxyl, the spectral features of which have been thoroughly reviewed by Aines and Rossman (1984).  When water is not fixed in a crystal lattice but is hydrogen-bonded to other water molecules, it results in a broad spectral feature centered near 2.9 micrometers due to O-H stretching vibrations and another near 6.1 micrometers due to H-O-H bending vibrations.  Such water may be present in fluid inclusions, as interlayer water in sheet silicates, or as water of hydration.  Water in a crystalline environment produces sharper O-H stretching absorption features than occur in the liquid water spectrum, which typically also occur at a shorter wavelength.  Multiple O-H stretching vibrations can result when water is present at several sites in the crystal lattice.  Beryl and cordierite, for example, contain water that resides at specific sites in channels parallel to the C axis (Aines and Rossman, 1984).  These minerals are also interesting because they typically have CO2  trapped in these channels, which produces sharp bands near 4.3 micrometers.\\\n",
    "                Minerals containing hydroxyl without water display O-H stretching features near 2.7 micrometers but lack the broad feature at 2.9 micrometers and the H-O-H bending mode at longer wavelength.  A good example is kaolinite, which has no interlayer water.  Most often, however, minerals display a combination of hydroxyl and molecular water bands, as in the case of antigorite.\\\n",
    "                Many minerals contain a trace of OH and water, although this is not reflected in their chemical formulae.  A good example is quartz, which typically displays multiple sharp O-H stretching features superimposed on a weak broad water band.  The broad water band is probably due to a small amount of liquid water in fluid inclusions.  The sharper hydroxyl features are associated with hydroxylated alkali metals that serve to balance charges when aluminum substitutes for silicon (Aines and Rossman, 1984).\\\n",
    "                In addition to the fundamental O-H and H-O-H features commonly seen in the spectra of minerals in the 2-7 micrometers region, a variety of significant metal cation-OH bands can be found at longer wavelegth, especially in clay minerals (Stubican and Roy, 1964).  Kaolinite, for example, displays a prominent Al-OH band near 11 micrometers.\\\n",
    "                OH lattice vibrations are typically seen at still longer wavelengths (Farmer, 1974, p. 348), such as the 16-micrometers feature in the spectrum of antigorite.\\\n",
    "                Water and hydroxyl bands are spectrally important because most silicate minerals capable of doing so have undergone incipient alteration to hydrous phases and/or contain fluid inclusions, even when appearing quite fresh, because of the ubiquity of water in the terrestrial environment.  This is in marked contrast to other environments, such as that of the moon (Roedder, 1984).  It should be pointed out that water and hydroxyl are usually not present in large amounts where they are not part of the mineral stoichiometry.  However, spectral features due to water and hydroxyl may be very prominent, especially in reflectance spectra of fine particulate materials.  This is due to the enhancement of such absorption bands by the increased scattering associated with fine particle size, which is discussed below.  Thus, an estimate of the abundance of water and hydroxyl relative to other phases can best be obtained from transmittance spectra.\\\n",
    "                Discussion of Spectra \\n \\\n",
    "                The Role of Surface and Volume Scattering:  \\n \\\n",
    "                All major studies of the nature of mineral spectra have used transmittance data (Farmer, 1974; Farmer and Palmieri, 1975, and references therein).  Transmittance spectra are simpler to interpret than reflectance or emittance spectra, because they depend solely on the absorption coefficient.  Reflectance and emittance spectra involve both the absorption coefficient and the refractive index, which causes spectral features to change quite significantly, especially when scattering becomes important in particulate samples (Salisbury et al., 1987b).\\\n",
    "                It is apparent from inspection of our mineral spectra that particle size has a very significant effect on reflectance spectra.  A mathematical model of reflectance from particulate samples has been developed by Hapke (1981).  We focus here on a qualitative physical model to provide a basic understanding of how and why spectral features change with particle size, addressing the role of surface and volume scattering.\\\n",
    "                The radiation returned to the observer in reflectance from a particulate sample has been scattered by the particles.  This scattering takes place by two processes: surface scattering, which involves rays that have reflected from the surfaces of grains without penetration; and volume scattering, which involves rays that have been refracted into grain interiors and then scattered or refracted back out.  Which of these processes dominates returned radiation is determined primarily by the absorption coefficient and particle size (Vincent and Hunt, 1968).\\\n",
    "                The wavelength variation in absorption coefficient can be determined from a transmittance spectrum.  This can be illustrated with quartz transmission spectra, where the highest absorption coefficient is associated with the Si-O stretching vibration near 9.2 micrometers.  A weaker band due to the bending mode near 21.5 micrometers is accompanied by the still weaker feature near 19.5 micrometers, and progressively weaker stretching features can be seen near 12.5, 12.7 and 14.5 micrometers.  \\\n",
    "                The effects of particle size on these spectral features of different intensity can be seen in our spectra of different particle size ranges of quartz.\\\n",
    "                Reflectance from the smooth surface of a solid sample, of course, eliminates multiple scattering.  As a result, the entire spectrum is dominated by simple Fresnel reflectance from the surface (Salisbury et al., 1987b), and the spectral features are reflectance peaks associated with the strongest molecular vibration bands.  The correlation of reflectance peaks with very strong absorption bands is counterintuitive to those researchers accustomed to working in the visible and near-infrared.  This effect is due to the very strong absorption coefficient associated with these bands, which induces a mirror-like opacity at these wavelengths.\\\n",
    "                For the coarse particulate 75-250 micrometers particle-size range, the reflectance peaks, or reststrahlen bands, discussed above are still apparent between 7.5 and 24 micrometers.  However the appearance of the spectrum between 2.1 and 7.5 micrometers has changed significantly.  Weak but distinct alkali metal-OH features can be seen between 2.8 and 3.2 micrometers, and a series of overtone/combination tone bands are visible between 3.5 and 7.5 micrometers.  These spectral features are all expressed as troughs, not peaks, showing that this region of the spectrum is dominated by volume scattering.  What has occurred is that the particle size has become small enough, on average, to allow passage of photons completely through the grains in this spectral region of relatively low absorption coefficient.  That is, the grains are optically thin.  More photons are absorbed in band centers than in band wings during volume scattering, and reflectance minima (troughs) occur.\\\n",
    "                Thus, for particulate silicates, the spectral range documented in this library is generally dominated by volume scattering and absorption band troughs on the left side of each figure and by surface scattering and absorption band peaks on the right side.  The dividing line is the sharp minimum in reflectance associated with the principal Christiansen frequency displayed for quartz at 7.4 micrometers.\\\n",
    "                Changes in spectral contrast:  \\n \\\n",
    "                Considering first the reflectance minima associated with volume scattering, band depth (Clark and Roush, 1984) is a measure of band intensity commonly referred to as spectral contrast.  It is apparent in comparing spectra of coarse and fine particulate size ranges that this spectral contrast changes with changing particle size.  However, the change is not consistent, spectral contrast sometimes increasing and sometimes decreasing with decreasing particle size.  The  explanation for this behavior lies in the relationship between mean optical path length and particle size, which can be illustrated with three cases.  Mean optical path length (MOPL) is the mean distance photons will pass through a material before total absorption takes place (Clark and Roush, 1984).  When the absorption coefficient is relatively high and the MOPL is much less than the mean grain diameter in a particulate sample, all photons entering the grains are absorbed.  If the MOPL remains smaller than the mean particle diameter, even at a finer particle-size range, photon absorption remains essentially unchanged.  Something close to this first case is seen in the centers of the overtone/combination tone bands of quartz near 5.4 and 6.2 micrometers.  The reflectance in these band centers increases only slightly in the spectrum of the finer particle-size range compared to that of the coarser size range (i.e., the band remains nearly saturated).  A better example is seen in the center of the hydroxyl stretching fundamental near 2.7 micrometers in the spectra of antigorite.  The band center remains saturated at about 1% reflectance for both coarse and fine particle-size ranges. \\\n",
    "                A second case occurs at intermediate absorption coefficient when the MOPL is initially on the order of the mean grain diameter.  As the particle size decreases, many more photons survive passage through the grains and a significantly larger portion of the incoming radiation will be scattered back in the direction of the observer.  This second case applies to the wings of the 5.4 and 6.2 micrometers bands of quartz and to the wings of the hydroxyl band of antigorite.  Here reflectance increases with decreasing particle size.\\\n",
    "                When the reflectance in the wings of a band rise significantly with decreasing particle size (Case 2), while the band center remains saturated or nearly so (Case 1), an increase in spectral contrast occurs.  This effect causes absorption bands having the right ranges of absorption coefficient between band wings and band centers to display intense bands at fine particle size.  This occurs not only for many of the silicate overtone/combination tone bands (especially for quartz and olivine) but also for carbonate and sulfate combination tones and the fundamental O-H and C-H stretching vibration bands.  Thus, spectra of fine particulate mineral mixtures may be dominated out of proportion to their abundance by minerals that display such spectral behavior, as shown elsewhere for igneous rocks and meteorites (Salisbury et al., 1989; Salisbury et al., 1991).A third illustrative case occurs when the MOPL is already much greater than mean particle diameter at the coarser particle size.  In this case, the bulk of potentially backscattered radiation is already returned to the observer at large particle size.  Thus, a reduction in mean grain diameter has proportionally less effect than when MOPL starts out close to mean grain diameter.  This third case applies to the wings of the weaker overtone/combinaton tone band of quartz near 4.5 micrometers.  Here the wings rise relatively less than the band center,  which is affected more by Case 2 scattering.  Thus, this band decreases in spectral contrast with decreasing particle size, which is the norm for weak bands displayed in the visible and near-infrared.\\\n",
    "                We turn now to the reststrahlen bands dominated by surface scattering.  These absorption bands produce prominent reflectance peaks for solid samples and at coarse particle size, which are greatly reduced in intensity for the fine particle size range.  In fact, the weakest reststrahlen reflectance peak of quartz at 14.5 micrometers turns into a trough at the finest particle size.  While changing particle size may have resulted in changes in single particle albedo and scattering geometry (Conel, 1969), Salisbury and Eastes (1985) focused on a physical model depending on porosity to explain the decline in spectral contrast of the reststrahlen bands.  They noted that when a very fine (<5 micrometers) powder is packed to reduce porosity, its spectrum displays reflectance peaks as prominent as those displayed by the coarser particle-size ranges.  They suggested that the increased porosity associated with fine particle size resulted in formation of photon traps.  That is, that the pores acted like small black bodies.  A similar explanation was offered earlier by Lyon (1964) and Aronson et al. (1966).  However, research in progress suggests that the change in shape and intensity of the reststrahlen bands is due more to the occurrence of substantial volume scattering at fine particle size rather than to photon trapping, which is essentially a surface scattering effect.  Briefly, it appears that the role of porosity is to physically separate 1-5 micrometers diameter particles that are optically thin, even in the reststrahlen bands (Hunt and Logan, 1972).  When such particles are separated by more than a wavelength, they scatter independently as optically thin, volume-scattering particles.  When packed closely together, however, they scatter coherently as if they were large, optically thick, surface-scattering particles.  Thus, the loss of spectral contrast of reststrahlen bands for materials of fine particle size appears to be due directly to particle size and only indirectly (but critically) to porosity.\\\n",
    "                It is important to note in any discussion of the spectral contrast of reststrahlen bands that such bands do persist in spectra of fine materials, even if reduced in intensity and changed in shape.  In addition, the reststrahlen bands of some minerals are more persistent than those of others.  As shown by Salisbury and Walter (1989) and Salisbury et al. (1991), quartz, olivine, and pyroxene display such persistent reststrahlen bands.  Thus, the reststrahlen region may suffer reduced spectral contrast but is by no means either featureless or useless in spectra of particulate mineral mixtures.  \\\n",
    "                Transparency peaks:  \\n \\\n",
    "                We have referred to the region of the spectrum where the reststrahlen bands occur as dominated by surface scattering.  This is obviously true for solid samples of silicates and for the coarse particle-size range, which exhibit prominent reflectance peaks.  However, it can be seen in the transmittance spectrum of quartz that a region of relatively high transparency exists between the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrational features in the vicinity of 10.5 to 12 micrometers.  The absorption coefficient here is low enough so that grains become optically thin and volume scattering of the Case 2 type (see above) occurs as the particle size range is reduced from 75-250 micrometers to 0-75 micrometers.  Because the strong reststrahlen reflectance peaks are greatly diminished at fine particle size, the broad transparency peak becomes a prominent feature centered at about 11 micrometers.  Such transparency peaks may be very prominent in the spectra of some minerals (e.g., antigorite).\\\n",
    "                Transparency peaks were first noted without explanation in reflectance spectra of rocks by Hovis and Callahan (1966).  Conel (1969) described and explained such features (expressed as troughs in emittance) in spectra of quartz.  Salisbury and Walter (1989) showed that the wavelength of the transparency peak could be related to the composition of igneous rocks.  Documented here is the spectral behavior of a wide range of rock-forming minerals, showing the nature and magnitude of transparency peaks that occur in reflectance of fine particulate samples.\\\n",
    "                Note that the prominence of this feature is dependent on the degree to which the adjacent reflectance peaks associated with the reststrahlen bands are diminished in spectra of the fine particle-size range.  As explained above, the loss of these peaks appears to be related to the increased porosity and volume scattering in a sample due to very fine particle size.  When a sample is sifted into a sample cup, the finest particles tend to be suspended in air and drift away during sifting.  Thus, a sample sifted and measured repeatedly will tend to increase in mean grain diameter and to display progressively stronger reststrahlen bands.  We have attempted to avoid this with our samples, but there is some obvious variability of reststrahen-band spectral contrast (compare acmite1f and acmite2f).  Also, a few samples were not prepared by us and vary in particle-size range as a result (olivine4, for example, is completely lacking in very fine particles).\\\n",
    "                Despite the fact that some minerals fail to display transparency features, it is apparent from the spectra in this volume that such peaks (expressed as troughs in emittance) could be prominent spectral features in the 8-14 micrometers spectrum of a fine-particulate regolith.  Salisbury et al. (1991) suggest that the distortion of a spectrum by the sharp thermal gradient associated with a vacuum environment may make such broad features difficult to detect, but further measurements of appropriate candidate materials in a simulated space environment are needed to confirm this.\\\n",
    "                Christiansen feature:  \\n \\\n",
    "                A final spectral feature that is prominent at fine particle size is associated with the principal Christiansen frequency.  This is a reflectance minimum that occurs because the real part of the refractive index undergoes rapid changes (anomalous dispersion) at a slightly shorter wavelength than the most intense molecular vibration band.  Consequently, the refractive index approaches 1, resulting in a minimum of scattering, at a wavelength where absorption is still relatively low.  With little scattering and little absorption, infrared radiation can penetrate a sample relatively easily, resulting in a minimum in reflectance or a maximum in emittance.  This feature can be seen in reflectance at all particle-size ranges, but it is one of the more easily recognized spectral features in reflectance of the finest particle-size range (e.g., near 7.3 micrometers for quartz).  Conel (1969) first showed that the wavelength of this feature is a good indicator of mineralogy.  Logan et al. (1973) showed that the wavelength of this feature can also be used to determine igneous rock type and demonstrated its utility for mapping compositional variations in the lunar regolith.  The relationship between wavelength of the Christiansen feature and composition has been determined on a more quantitative basis for igneous rocks by Walter and Salisbury (1989) and for meteorites by Salisbury et al. (1991).\\\n",
    "                The Effect of Crystallographic Orientation:  \\n \\\n",
    "                Many minerals are birefringent and have a different spectral response depending on crystallographic orientation.  This is illustrated in the solid sample spectra of orthoclase.  The occurrence of such orientation effects is what makes it necessary to sift particulate samples, or at least their upper millimeter, into sample cups for measurement.  Tapping a cup or using a knife edge to level a  sample tends to orient the grains, especially if the mineral has a prominent cleavage.  Some samples having an extremely asymmetric shape, such as micas, will tend to develop grain orientation despite sifting.  Our laboratory studies of calcite show, however, that more equant grains are randomly oriented when sifted, despite very strongly developed cleavage.\\\n",
    "                The Effect of Packing:  \\n \\\n",
    "                As discussed above in the section on spectral contrast, it has been shown that packing a fine particulate sample to reduce its porosity will greatly increase the prominence of the fundamental molecular vibration bands.  Thus, spectra of packed samples are presented for some minerals, such as clays, for which coarse-grained samples showing the fundamental molecular vibration bands are not available.  Packing will tend to orient the grains parallel to their strongest cleavage or parting, so that these spectra are most similar to solid sample spectra obtained in that orientation. \\\n",
    "                The Effect of Atmospheric Gases:  \\n \\\n",
    "                A spectrometer must be vigorously purged with dry nitrogen (or dry air from which CO2 has been removed) in order to avoid incorporating band structure due to atmospheric H2O and CO2 in the spectra.  Spectra of some samples were obtained without adequate purging and display extremely weak atmospheric bands (e.g. the solid sample spectrum of acmite1).  These atmospheric bands are usually easy to identify and do not interfere with the major molecular vibration bands of the silicates, so these spectra were retained in the library.  Some minerals, such as beryl, cordierite, and topaz, contain CO2 gas trapped in channels or in fluid inclusions within the minerals.\\\n",
    "                The Effect of Impurities:  \\n \\\n",
    "                Two kinds of impurities introduce spectral artifacts: those that are added to the sample during laboratory processing and those that were an original part of the sample.  Impurities added include water (in KBr pellets) and hydrocarbon, while the most common impurities within samples are quartz, calcite, and products of  exsolution and alteration.\\\n",
    "                KBr pellets are pressed under vacuum to remove water, but the material is so hygroscopic that this process quickly begins to reverse.  The method chosen to compensate for this was to ratio the sample pellet transmittance against that of a blank pellet  made under identical circumstances.  If the KBr for both pellets was initially ground to the same particle size so that the same surface area was available to atmospheric water vapor, held under vacuum for the same amount of time to remove water, and then exposed to humid room air for the same amount of time in transfer (as pellets) to the purged and dry environment of the spectrometer sample compartment, the KBr of both pellets should contain the same amount of water.  Then a ratio of sample transmittance to that of the blank pellet should display water bands that are intrinsic to the sample only.  However, in practice the sample transmittance spectrum sometimes displays more of a water band than the reflectance data suggest is reasonable.  The transmittance spectrum of kyanite, for example, displays a strong molecular water band at 2.9 micrometers, but the lack of such a band in the spectrum of the 75-250 micrometers size range suggests that the KBr pellet is contaminated by introduced water.  This water appears to be introduced as water absorbed on the very fine (<2 micrometers) particulate sample grains.  We have tried to avoid this effect by grinding the samples under alcohol, but it remains a source of error in the spectral data.  Thus, the broad water-absorption bands centered at 2.9 micrometers in transmittance should be used with caution to estimate sample water content and should be verified with reflectance data.  \\\n",
    "                It should also be noted that sample pellet and blank pellet sometimes do not contain an identical amount of KBr because of lost material squeezed past the die during pressing.  This has caused a few transmittance spectra to exceed 100%, but it is a significant problem only at the short wavelength end of the spectrum, where the samples typically have very low absorbance.\\\n",
    "                Sample spectra often display weak fundamental C-H stretching vibration bands (a triplet)near 3.3 micrometers.  Solid samples typically have acquired fingerprints to account for their C-H bands, although some samples appear to have been contaminated by some oily lubricant used with a rock saw.  Particulate samples may be contaminated by hydrocarbons in several ways.  First, they were ground under alcohol or acetone as described above.  Despite oven drying of these samples at 100� C, a trace of hydrocarbon may remain.  We also find that particulate samples simply exposed to laboratory air will, over time, develop similar hydrocarbon bands due to adsorbed species.  These spectral artifacts, like the water vapor bands, are usually so weak that they are difficult to detect at the scale at which spectra are presented in this book, but can be see, for example, in the fine particle size spectrum of grossular garnet (grossu2f). \\\n",
    "                Samples contaminated with quartz were rejected, because quartz bands are so strong that even a small amount will introduce interfering bands.  Samples contaminated with calcite (or dolomite) were treated with either acetic or hydrochloric acid to remove the contaminant.  It was found that an exceedingly small amount of carbonate can usually be detected as a contaminant, because two of the carbonate overtone/combination band near 4 micrometers that gains spectral contrast at fine particle size occur where silicates tend to be transparent.  The spectrum of the coarse 75-250 micrometers size range of epidote is a good illustration of this and also demonstrates that the infrared spectrum is more sensitive than X-ray analysis for detection of very small quantities of carbonate.\\\n",
    "                Some minerals tend to contain exsolution products, and we have included several of these in our collection, despite their lack of perfect purity, because exsolution is so common.  Microcline.1, for example, contains cryptoperthitic high albite, as does sanidine.3.  Hypersthene.1 contains a small amount of exsolved clinopyroxene. \\\n",
    "                As discussed above (see Major Spectral Features of Minerals), water is ubiquitous in terrestrial environments and terrestrial minerals subject to alteration have inevitably been slightly altered, even when quite fresh in appearance.  Hydroxyl O-H stretching vibration bands tend to become more prominent (i.e., gain spectral contrast) as particle size decreases, as discussed above.  At the same time, silicate minerals normally lacking hydroxyl tend to be quite transparent in the 2.6-3.0 micrometers region.  Consequently, hydroxyl bands due to a very small amount of alteration product typically are very prominently expressed in reflectance spectra of the 0-75 micrometers particle-size range.  Transmittance spectra give a better idea of the absolute amount of alteration product present.  A good example can be seen in spectra of kyanite, which shows no hydroxyl bands superimposed on the broad water band in its transmittance spectrum near 2.7 micrometers, indicating the presence of very little hydroxyl, but does show very strong and distinctive kaolinite hydroxyl bands near 2.7 micrometers in the spectrum of the 0-75 micrometers particle-size range.\\\n",
    "                Relating Laboratory Data to Remote Sensing Measurements:  \\n \\\n",
    "                The crossover point (i.e., point of equal energy) for reflectance and emittance for most remote sensing targets in the solar system lies somewhere in the 2.5-5 micrometers region, depending on the albedo and temperature of the surface.  Thus, most of the spectral range presented in this work is dominated by emittance.  Yet, spectral data are presented in reflectance, primarily because reflectance is much easier to measure in the laboratory.  Spectral emissivity is usually predicted from reflectance of opaque materials using Kirchhoffs Law, typically stated in its simplest form (without wavelength or directional subscripts) as E=1-R, where E and R are emissivity and reflectance (Nicodemus, 1965).  Even in regions of relative transparency, where volume scattering dominates the powder spectra, the samples used in this study can be considered opaque because of their thickness.  However, the direct application of Kirchhoffs Law to the spectral library presented here is not possible because measurements were made in biconical, rather than hemispherical, reflectance.  This means that the library spectra do not provide a quantitative measure of the infrared radiation scattered in all directions, as do the relatively few directional hemispherical reflectance spectra described in the next section.  However, laboratory and field measurements have repeatedly shown that biconical reflectance measurements may be used qualitatively to predict emissivity (Lyon, 1964; Hunt and Vincent, 1968, Bartholomew et al., 1989).  That is, the shape of the spectral curves in our mineral library can be used to predict the shapes, but not the absolute intensities, of spectral curves in emittance.  Thus, our library of mineral spectra may be used qualitatively in spectral searches of remote sensing data to identify unknown minerals.  Quantitative prediction of the magnitude, as well as the kind, of spectral features to be seen in spectral emittance requires directional hemispherical reflectance measurements, such as those described in the next section.  Such measurements capture both the forward and backscattered radiation, so that an absolute measurement is obtained of R.  One caveat, however, is that Kirchhoffs Law holds true only under isothermal conditions.  As shown by Logan et al. (1973), a vacuum environment fosters a thermal gradient in the uppermost few micrometers of a particulate sample that may exaggerate spectral contrast and distort spectral features.  As shown by Salisbury and Walter (1989), however, systematic correction factors can be developed to predict the effect of a vacuum environment on spectral features.  Fortunately, the presence of an atmosphere, even a thin martian-type atmosphere, leaves the thermal gradient and spectral contrast little changed from terrestrial conditions.  Thus, it appears that the biconical reflectance spectra illustrated in this book may be used to qualitatively predict spectral emissivity in a variety of potential remote sensing environments.\\\n",

    "                Using quantitative directional hemispherical reflectance spectra, Thompson and Salisbury (1991) have recently shown that the spectra of silicate minerals in the reststrahlen region combine linearly to make up the spectra of mineral mixtures for particles large enough to be optically thick (e.g., the 75-250 micrometers size range).   \\\n",
